# vue-webpack-ts template

> A full-featured Webpack setup with hot-reload, lint-on-save, unit testing & css extraction, typescript enabled.

This is a fork of the official [vuejs webpack template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) with added typescript support.

```bash
vue init undefinederror/vue-webpack-ts <myproject>
```
Just answer "Y" at the the question "Use typescript?"

Please refer to the [official documentation](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack) for support in how to use the vue-cli or vuejs in general
